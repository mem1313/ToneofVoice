# ToneofVoice
A senior design product to implement emotion into Speech Generation Devices(SGDs)

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), including speech generating devices, can provide important benefits for individuals with disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, ALS, Down's syndrome) who have difficulty communicating with speech. These devices, however, typically make use of a single tone of voice, and therefore the devices do not appropriately convey the emotion (e.g., joy, anger, sorrow) of the person who is using the device to communicate. The goal is that the team generate original solutions to the challenge of providing users with expressive control over the tone of speech produced by the speech generating device.
